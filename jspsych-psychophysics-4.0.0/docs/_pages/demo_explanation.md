The elapsed time after begging of a trial is presented both in milliseconds and in frames.
- [raf_func.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/raf_func.html) A circle moves on a virtual circumference. This file demonstrates how to use the raf_func which is called by the requestAnimationFrame method, and excuted synchronized with the refresh of the display. You can directly access the canvas (of which the context) using the raf_func. You can draw complex visual stimuli.
- Advanced! [draw_two_images_repeatedly.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/draw_two_images_repeatedly.html)-[CodePen](https://codepen.io/kurokida/pen/KKqwLax) This file demonstrates how to present two images repeatedly until a participant responds to them.

- [pixi_mental_rotation.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/pixi_mental_rotation.html) This file demonstrates how to rotate the stimulus charactor in the pixi mode. You can also rotate the image in a similar fashion.

# Other stimuli

- [cross.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/cross.html)-[CodePen](https://codepen.io/kurokida/pen/rNwaxRP) The cross object can be used to present a fixation point. In this demo, moving two cross are presented.

There are two ways to define a line; one is to specify the `angle` and `line_length`, the other is to specify the start (x1, y1) and end (x2, y2) positions of the line. Note that you can not specify both the angle and positions for the same object.
- [rectangles.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/rectangles.html) This file demonstrates how to present (moving) rectangles.
- [texts.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/texts.html) The 'Hello world!' demonstration. You can start a new line using the '\n'. Texts can be moved as the same as rectangles.

- [movingCircles.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/movingCircles.html) This file demonstrates how to present moving circles. There are three ways to define motion. (1) Using the distance and time, (2) Using the distance and speed, and (3) Using the time and speed. Note: You can not specify the speed, distance, and time at the same time.
- [movingCircles_frames.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/movingCircles_frames.html) This demonstration is the same as the movingCircles.html except for specifying the timing information in terms of frames. The `show_start(end)_frame` property is used instead of the `show_start(end)_time`. Also, `the motion_start(end)_frame` property is used instead of the `motion_start(end)_time`. Note that if you define motion using the distance and time, you have to specify the time in milliseconds not in frames.
- [manual_drawFunc_gradation.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/manual_drawFunc_gradation.html) A visuals timulus graduated from white to black moves from left to right. This program uses the `drawFunc` function.

# TIPS
