            <p><b>Study procedure</b><br>
              This is a computer-based study. It will take you about 1 minute to complete the study.
            </p>

            <p><b>Methods and data collected</b><br>
              During this study, you will be required to rate words.
            <p>	

            <p><b>Voluntary participation and anonymity</b><br>
              Participation in the study is entirely voluntary. You can decide to stop participating in the study at any time and without providing reasons. 
              This will not cause any disadvantages. If you do so, you are entitled to remuneration for the time you spent on participating in the study. 
              In such a case, please contact the experimenter via <i>[e-mail / Prolific]</i> to be reimbursed.</p>
            <p>All data and personal messages will be treated confidentially. The researchers involved in the study are subject to the duty of
              confidentiality. The results of the study will be published in anonymized form and cannot be linked to you.</p>

            <p><b>Data protection</b><br> 
              Data collection will be anonymous and we will never ask for your name. Data collected during the study cannot be linked to you. If you 
              decide to withdraw from participating in the study, no data will be recorded. All data will be saved on a server managed by the Language 
              and Cognition Research Group at the University of Tübingen. There will be no disclosure of data to third parties. 
              Data storage and data processing will follow the standards of the European data protection law.</p>
            <p>After analyzing the data, we plan to publish the data in anonymized form in an online repository. 
              The publication of research data serves to ensure scientific integrity. For instance, this helps other researchers to 
              reproduce data analysis procedures or to test alternative data analysis procedures.</p>

            </p>

              been committed to protect the privacy of all users and to store and process data in accordance with the standards of the European data protection law.
